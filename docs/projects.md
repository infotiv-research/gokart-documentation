# Thesis Projects

Requirements:

 * Modular architecture
 * Documentation
 * Test

Customers:

 * Interns and Thesis work
 * Resaerch Projects
 * Educational platform for External customer

Please contact us if you are interested to work on any of these projects:

## NextGen Autonomous Platform

- Upgrading the ECUs (Nvidia Jetson)
- Simplification and Modularization of electrical body
- Documnetaion and Test design

## Verification and Validation

* Diagnostic system (SIL, unit tests and internal checks)
* System level Test (HIL)


## Autonomous Platform Machine Learning Module

Using available sensors extend the functinality of openpilot for:

- Driver Awareness and Monitoring Systems (DMS)
- ADAS
- Traffic Sign Detection (Speed limit, ...)
- Pedestrain Detection

There are improvements that needs to be done to finalize this project:
Running OpenPilot on Jetson board (rather than an external laptop)
Receving camera image frames through ROS (rather than via USB camera)

## Autonomous Platform Infotainment Dashboard

- Visualisation
- Interactive interfaces

## Autonomous Platform Telematic System

- Remote Update (Microcontroller and other ECUs)
- Transmission of Sensor Data (Camera, Lidar, ...)
- Real time remote control
