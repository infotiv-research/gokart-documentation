# System Goal and Scope
This project will generate the base for thesis works as well as internship projects. These projects will be designed to further develop the platform and in turn create new projects. These projects will also generate new educations relevant to the area.
The overarching design choices should reflect the SPA platform, such as ECUâ€™s and the system architecture, and use this as inspiration for the entire platform. 
Testing will be done in office or in a controlled environment, a go-kart track as example, to simulate real life situations. 

The technical scope of this project will be ever-changing depending on current market, internal resources and new technology within the automotive industry. It will include, but not limited to, development in areas such as: electrical hardware, mechanical hardware, software, AI, machine learning, PCB design, battery, telematics, embedded systems, electromobility, apps and UX design.
The end goal is to have a autonomous go-kart, be it in a controlled test environment and go-kart scaled, that furthers development and research in the autonomus veachle idustry.
Once the gokart platform is in a stable state, extrenal reserch eneties could use this to test other ideas applicable to the platform.

The project is limited by size of the go-kart and the speed of the motor (24km/h). The size will impact the overarching HW choice of the platform and thereby the software. Even if the systems will be built with a real car and the SPA platform in mind, deviations from a real car system will be apparent. Also, reliability and quality will differ as many of the projects run on the platform will be first implementations. 
The development process will also be limited by what test cases can be made as the speed and the built up environments are restricted as the go-kart not road worthy. 
Restraints caused by the Go-kart and Ninebot S SW/HW, such as limited control over individual funtions and lacking documentation regarding the internal mechanisms.

The Education platform shall be used to visualize and educate staff, and as a second step external customers, in the different techniques that are included in Infotiv's competence areas. The product shall be in form of a small vehicle which shall have the possibility of scalability. Developing an autonomous driving platform that is closer to a real car opens a multitude of developing opportunities as well as increasing the value of the existing project. The research and development done on the new go-kart will face more similar issues as the industry is facing.
