# Infotiv Autonomous Platform

To increase the knowledge and expertise within the evolving automotive industry Infotiv developed the IES Education Platform. A multitude of thesis works, internships and internal projects have been done with this platform and this has bettered Infotiv’s competitive edge. The end goal is to have a autonomous go-kart, be it in a controlled test environment and go-kart scaled, that furthers development and research in the autonomus veachle idustry. Once the gokart platform is in a stable state, extrenal research entities could use the platform to test and try their own ideas.



Developing a platform that is closer to car opens a multitude of developing opportunities as well as increasing the value of the existing project, proving scalability. The research and development done on the new go-kart till face more similar issues as the industry is facing. Infotiv having this knowledge and how to solve these issues would further increase Infotiv’s competitive edge.
This platform will also give opportunity to develop other types of driver focused applications, some examples being lane assistance, driver interface and adaptive cruise control. 

The goal of the project is to add a driver assistance system capable of performing basic functions such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) to the existing GoKart framework. The GoKart was the result of previous research within Infotiv.


# System Architecture

The system is designed in three steps as a separated projects. 

1. [Automotive platform](platform.md)
2. [Body electronics](bodyelec.md)
3. [Autonomous Drive](autonomous.md)
